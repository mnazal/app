The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["url2=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChitranjanUpadhayay/ML_Projects/main/Datasets/Fake%20News/Fake.csv\"\n","fake=pd.read_csv(url2)"],"metadata":{"id":"fCqzrvVp5tY2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713104185038,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3955,"user":{"displayName":"Navami Narendralal","userId":"00402566610407973976"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["fake.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"guo3tnb150ta","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713104187972,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1181,"user":{"displayName":"Navami Narendralal","userId":"00402566610407973976"}},"outputId":"d98f3298-3e58-4871-d0fb-302519fb8bea"},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               title  \\\n","0   Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Year’...   \n","1   Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian ...   \n","2   Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke...   \n","3   Trump Is So Obsessed He Even Has Obama’s Name...   \n","4   Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump Dur...   \n","\n","                                                text subject  \\\n","0  Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans ...

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":25}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["true['label']=1\n","fake['label']=0"],"metadata":{"id":"0gnot3l56NwY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713104191717,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":681,"user":{"displayName":"Navami Narendralal","userId":"00402566610407973976"}}},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df=pd.concat([fake,true]).reset_index(drop=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"SRfJRLq06RGO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713104294916,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":440,"user":{"displayName":"Navami Narendralal","userId":"00402566610407973976"}}},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df=df.sample(frac=1)"],"metadata":{"id":"CUgR8kRs6vmh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713104297715,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":393,"user":{"displayName":"Navami Narendralal","userId":"00402566610407973976"}}},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df=df.drop(['title','subject','date'],axis=1)\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"wJ46mFs87W6c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713104300689,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1085,"user":{"displayName":"Navami Narendralal","userId":"00402566610407973976"}},"outputId":"528b054e-f9be-4f34-ab2e-5998f56d2879"},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                    text  label\n","6632   All the months of speculation that the modern ...      0\n","29162  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -

Some were wondering if Trump has just been saying these things to pander to Republican voters, but new audio reveals he s always done some pretty racist things.For instance, back in 2005 while on Howard Stern s radio program, Trump brought up the fact that he put thought into doing a season of The Apprentice that would feature black people versus white people. Fortunately, NBC knew that idea wasn t going to fly.Trump told Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers: On  The Apprentice there was a concept, okay, thrown out by some person, nine blacks against nine whites. And it would be nine blacks against nine whites, all highly educated, very smart, strong, beautiful. Do you like it? Do you like it, Robin? Quivers responded: I think you re gonna have a riot. But Trump being Trump, said: It would be the highest-rated show on television. Then when Stern asked: Very dark blacks, or light-skinned blacks? Trump responded with,  assortment  against whites. After Trump admitted that NBC didn t like the idea (duh) and Stern very astutely made the prediction it would cause tension, Trump declared that it wouldn t cause racial tension, saying: It would be handled very beautifully by me. Because, as you know, I m very diplomatic  Also, I think you d have 35 million people a night watching. Adding: There s something wrong with it, but I don t know, maybe we should think about it. It seems as if this was much more than a passing thought or idea in the production office for The Apprentice. Trump clearly put a lot of thought into how he might be able to make this idea fly and get greenlit.So, if you had any remaining doubt that Trump might not actually be racist, this should clear things up for you.

He has been interviewed many times over the Trump Administration s troubles with Russia and his latest statement is sure to make the Trump White House furious   that s to say nothing of how Donald Trump himself will react when he gets wind of these comments.During remarks he was making at Australia s National Press Club, Clapper said of Trump s scandal-ridden White House: I lived through Watergate. It was a scary time, I have to say though that I think, you know, compare the two, that Watergate pales in my view compared to what we re confronting now. Apparently, Clapper continued to go all in on Trump, as Australian reporter Paul Karp tweeted out the contents of what Clapper was saying:Clapper is absolutely shirtfronting Trump at #NPC #auspol pic.twitter.com/avN2VxKlOR  Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) June 7, 2017This is not the first time Clapper has openly spoken of Trump with contempt; in fact, he recently suggested to Jake Tapper, host of the CNN news shows The Lead and State of the Union, that Trump is a threat to the very fabric of the republic, saying: I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally and that s the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally. When Tapper pressed Clapper about what he meant about the institutional danger from the inside, Clapper said he meant Trump.Of course, Clapper is correct. Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a boy scout. There has never been such an assault on our Republic from within the very top levels of government, and certainly we ve never had a president who was in the pocket of the Russians the way Trump is. No, this is far, far worse than Watergate, and that is why we must find a way to remove the entire Trump Administration from office as soon as possible.Watch Clapper s remarks below:Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":36}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.reset_index(inplace=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"JDdgLgeq79SI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713104303994,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":472,"user":{"displayName":"Navami Narendralal","userId":"00402566610407973976"}}},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"frDv5DBr8Gip","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713104308453,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1089,"user":{"displayName":"Navami Narendralal","userId":"00402566610407973976"}},"outputId":"6056c675-31ee-4dda-f0c3-d941b02a349d"},"execution_count":38,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   index                                               text  label\n","0   6632  All the months of speculation that the modern ...      0\n","1  29162  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -

Some were wondering if Trump has just been saying these things to pander to Republican voters, but new audio reveals he s always done some pretty racist things.For instance, back in 2005 while on Howard Stern s radio program, Trump brought up the fact that he put thought into doing a season of The Apprentice that would feature black people versus white people. Fortunately, NBC knew that idea wasn t going to fly.Trump told Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers: On  The Apprentice there was a concept, okay, thrown out by some person, nine blacks against nine whites. And it would be nine blacks against nine whites, all highly educated, very smart, strong, beautiful. Do you like it? Do you like it, Robin? Quivers responded: I think you re gonna have a riot. But Trump being Trump, said: It would be the highest-rated show on television. Then when Stern asked: Very dark blacks, or light-skinned blacks? Trump responded with,  assortment  against whites. After Trump admitted that NBC didn t like the idea (duh) and Stern very astutely made the prediction it would cause tension, Trump declared that it wouldn t cause racial tension, saying: It would be handled very beautifully by me. Because, as you know, I m very diplomatic  Also, I think you d have 35 million people a night watching. Adding: There s something wrong with it, but I don t know, maybe we should think about it. It seems as if this was much more than a passing thought or idea in the production office for The Apprentice. Trump clearly put a lot of thought into how he might be able to make this idea fly and get greenlit.So, if you had any remaining doubt that Trump might not actually be racist, this should clear things up for you.

He has been interviewed many times over the Trump Administration s troubles with Russia and his latest statement is sure to make the Trump White House furious   that s to say nothing of how Donald Trump himself will react when he gets wind of these comments.During remarks he was making at Australia s National Press Club, Clapper said of Trump s scandal-ridden White House: I lived through Watergate. It was a scary time, I have to say though that I think, you know, compare the two, that Watergate pales in my view compared to what we re confronting now. Apparently, Clapper continued to go all in on Trump, as Australian reporter Paul Karp tweeted out the contents of what Clapper was saying:Clapper is absolutely shirtfronting Trump at #NPC #auspol pic.twitter.com/avN2VxKlOR  Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) June 7, 2017This is not the first time Clapper has openly spoken of Trump with contempt; in fact, he recently suggested to Jake Tapper, host of the CNN news shows The Lead and State of the Union, that Trump is a threat to the very fabric of the republic, saying: I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally and that s the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally. When Tapper pressed Clapper about what he meant about the institutional danger from the inside, Clapper said he meant Trump.Of course, Clapper is correct. Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a boy scout. There has never been such an assault on our Republic from within the very top levels of government, and certainly we ve never had a president who was in the pocket of the Russians the way Trump is.

Some were wondering if Trump has just been saying these things to pander to Republican voters, but new audio reveals he s always done some pretty racist things.For instance, back in 2005 while on Howard Stern s radio program, Trump brought up the fact that he put thought into doing a season of The Apprentice that would feature black people versus white people. Fortunately, NBC knew that idea wasn t going to fly.Trump told Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers: On  The Apprentice there was a concept, okay, thrown out by some person, nine blacks against nine whites. And it would be nine blacks against nine whites, all highly educated, very smart, strong, beautiful. Do you like it? Do you like it, Robin? Quivers responded: I think you re gonna have a riot. But Trump being Trump, said: It would be the highest-rated show on television. Then when Stern asked: Very dark blacks, or light-skinned blacks? Trump responded with,  assortment  against whites. After Trump admitted that NBC didn t like the idea (duh) and Stern very astutely made the prediction it would cause tension, Trump declared that it wouldn t cause racial tension, saying: It would be handled very beautifully by me. Because, as you know, I m very diplomatic  Also, I think you d have 35 million people a night watching. Adding: There s something wrong with it, but I don t know, maybe we should think about it. It seems as if this was much more than a passing thought or idea in the production office for The Apprentice. Trump clearly put a lot of thought into how he might be able to make this idea fly and get greenlit.So, if you had any remaining doubt that Trump might not actually be racist, this should clear things up for you.

He has been interviewed many times over the Trump Administration s troubles with Russia and his latest statement is sure to make the Trump White House furious   that s to say nothing of how Donald Trump himself will react when he gets wind of these comments.During remarks he was making at Australia s National Press Club, Clapper said of Trump s scandal-ridden White House: I lived through Watergate. It was a scary time, I have to say though that I think, you know, compare the two, that Watergate pales in my view compared to what we re confronting now. Apparently, Clapper continued to go all in on Trump, as Australian reporter Paul Karp tweeted out the contents of what Clapper was saying:Clapper is absolutely shirtfronting Trump at #NPC #auspol pic.twitter.com/avN2VxKlOR  Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) June 7, 2017This is not the first time Clapper has openly spoken of Trump with contempt; in fact, he recently suggested to Jake Tapper, host of the CNN news shows The Lead and State of the Union, that Trump is a threat to the very fabric of the republic, saying: I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally and that s the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally. When Tapper pressed Clapper about what he meant about the institutional danger from the inside, Clapper said he meant Trump.Of course, Clapper is correct. Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a boy scout. There has never been such an assault on our Republic from within the very top levels of government, and certainly we ve never had a president who was in the pocket of the Russians the way Trump is. No, this is far, far worse than Watergate, and that is why we must find a way to remove the entire Trump Administration from office as soon as possible.Watch Clapper s remarks below:Featured image via

She will also meet with other leaders, the campaign added.  \",\n          \"Throughout this presidential race, Donald Trump has said a number of racist things that have drawn outrage from those who have a soul and merriment from those who are pure evil. Some were wondering if Trump has just been saying these things to pander to Republican voters, but new audio reveals he s always done some pretty racist things.For instance, back in 2005 while on Howard Stern s radio program, Trump brought up the fact that he put thought into doing a season of The Apprentice that would feature black people versus white people. Fortunately, NBC knew that idea wasn t going to fly.Trump told Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers: On  The Apprentice there was a concept, okay, thrown out by some person, nine blacks against nine whites. And it would be nine blacks against nine whites, all highly educated, very smart, strong, beautiful. Do you like it? Do you like it, Robin? Quivers responded: I think you re gonna have a riot. But Trump being Trump, said: It would be the highest-rated show on television. Then when Stern asked: Very dark blacks, or light-skinned blacks? Trump responded with,  assortment  against whites. After Trump admitted that NBC didn t like the idea (duh) and Stern very astutely made the prediction it would cause tension, Trump declared that it wouldn t cause racial tension, saying: It would be handled very beautifully by me. Because, as you know, I m very diplomatic  Also, I think you d have 35 million people a night watching. Adding: There s something wrong with it, but I don t know, maybe we should think about it. It seems as if this was much more than a passing thought or idea in the production office for The Apprentice. Trump clearly put a lot of thought into how he might be able to make this idea fly and get greenlit.So, if you had any remaining doubt that Trump might not actually be racist, this should clear things up for you.

He has been interviewed many times over the Trump Administration s troubles with Russia and his latest statement is sure to make the Trump White House furious   that s to say nothing of how Donald Trump himself will react when he gets wind of these comments.During remarks he was making at Australia s National Press Club, Clapper said of Trump s scandal-ridden White House: I lived through Watergate. It was a scary time, I have to say though that I think, you know, compare the two, that Watergate pales in my view compared to what we re confronting now. Apparently, Clapper continued to go all in on Trump, as Australian reporter Paul Karp tweeted out the contents of what Clapper was saying:Clapper is absolutely shirtfronting Trump at #NPC #auspol pic.twitter.com/avN2VxKlOR  Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) June 7, 2017This is not the first time Clapper has openly spoken of Trump with contempt; in fact, he recently suggested to Jake Tapper, host of the CNN news shows The Lead and State of the Union, that Trump is a threat to the very fabric of the republic, saying: I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally and that s the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally. When Tapper pressed Clapper about what he meant about the institutional danger from the inside, Clapper said he meant Trump.Of course, Clapper is correct. Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a boy scout. There has never been such an assault on our Republic from within the very top levels of government, and certainly we ve never had a president who was in the pocket of the Russians the way Trump is. No, this is far, far worse than Watergate, and that is why we must find a way to remove the entire Trump Administration from office as soon as possible.Watch Clapper s remarks below:Featured image via
